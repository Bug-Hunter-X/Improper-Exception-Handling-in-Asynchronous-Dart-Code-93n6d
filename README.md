# Improper Exception Handling in Asynchronous Dart Code

This repository demonstrates a common error in Dart: improper exception handling within asynchronous operations. The example shows how failing to handle exceptions effectively can lead to unexpected behavior or crashes in your application.

The `bug.dart` file contains the flawed code.  The `bugSolution.dart` file offers a corrected approach, showcasing best practices for handling exceptions in asynchronous Dart code.

## How to reproduce the bug:

1. Run `bug.dart`. 
2. Observe the console output â€“ the exception is caught, but rethrowing it isn't always the best solution. 
3. Compare this to the solution in `bugSolution.dart` for a more robust approach.
